      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Start-Up Visa (SUV) Program offers a direct pathway for entrepreneurs to bring their business to Canada and establish permanent residency for themselves and their families. Designed for innovators and business leaders, the program links you with private sector investors in Canada, helping you gain not only funding but also the expertise to launch your venture successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Canada’s Start-Up Visa Program is an incredible opportunity for business founders to access global markets, take advantage of Canada’s strong economic environment, and settle down with their families. The program provides permanent residency regardless of business success, making it the best route for entrepreneurs looking to relocate and establish a life in Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if you don’t have a business idea yet, we can help! At Diverse Visa, we assist with refining or developing a viable business idea that meets the program’s criteria, ensuring you’re set up for success from the start.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Program Overview</h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Qualifying Business</h3>
        <p>
          You must own a business that meets Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) criteria. This includes demonstrating innovation, scalability, and the potential for creating jobs in Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time of receiving permanent residency, you must actively manage the business from within Canada and conduct a significant portion of its operations here.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Language Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          You must meet a minimum Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) Level 5 in English or French across speaking, listening, reading, and writing abilities. Accepted language tests include IELTS or CELPIP for English and TCF Canada or TEF Canada for French.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Letter of Support</h3>
        <p>
          Secure a Letter of Support from a designated organization, such as a venture capital firm, angel investor group, or business incubator. This is essential for demonstrating that your business has strong backing in Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don’t have a business idea or need help refining it, Diverse Visa can assist in building a business model that fits the program’s criteria and attracts investor support.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Settlement Funds</h3>
        <p>
          Proof of sufficient funds to settle yourself and your family in Canada is required. The required amount depends on the number of dependents you plan to bring.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why It's Perfect for Families</h2>
        <p>
          One of the main advantages of the Start-Up Visa Program is that it allows the entire family to immigrate to Canada. While the principal applicant builds the business, family members are granted permanent residency and can enjoy all the benefits Canada has to offer, including access to healthcare and education.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s no age limit, making it ideal for families at any stage of life.
        </p>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Processing Time</h2>
        <p>
          The overall timeline for securing permanent residency through the Start-Up Visa Program is approximately 12 to 18 months. Securing a Letter of Support from a designated organization takes around 4 to 6 months. Applicants are eligible for a temporary work permit while the permanent residency application is processed.
