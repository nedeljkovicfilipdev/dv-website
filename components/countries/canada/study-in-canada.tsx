        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Study Permit Program is the gateway for international students to access world-class education in Canada while also gaining valuable work experience during their studies. This program allows students to study at designated learning institutions (DLIs) in Canada and work part-time while enrolled in their courses. For many students, the study permit becomes a stepping stone to permanent residency in Canada, offering a clear pathway toward building a life in one of the most student-friendly countries in the world.

          At Diverse Visa, we assist students with every step of the process, ensuring that their educational journey in Canada is smooth and successful.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Program Overview</h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Eligibility Requirements</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li><strong>Acceptance into a Designated Learning Institution (DLI):</strong> Before applying for a study permit, students must first be accepted into a recognized DLI in Canada.</li>
          <li><strong>Proof of Financial Support:</strong> Students must show proof that they have enough funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses for themselves and family members (if applicable), and return transportation.</li>
          <li><strong>English or French Proficiency:</strong> While language tests may not be required for the permit itself, students may need to prove their proficiency in English or French as part of their application to Canadian institutions. Popular tests include IELTS or TOEFL for English and TEF for French.</li>
          <li><strong>Good Health and No Criminal Record:</strong> Students may need to submit to a medical exam and provide police certificates to ensure they meet Canada’s health and security standards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Work While Studying</h3>
        <p>
          With a study permit, students can work up to 20 hours per week during regular academic sessions and full-time during scheduled breaks (such as winter and summer holidays). This work experience can help students gain a foothold in the Canadian labor market and start building a network for future opportunities.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP)</h3>
        <p>
          After completing their studies, students may be eligible for a Post-Graduation Work Permit, which allows them to work in Canada for up to three years. This work permit is a crucial step toward gaining Canadian work experience and applying for permanent residency.
