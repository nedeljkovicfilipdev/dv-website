        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) work permit is one of the primary ways for skilled foreign workers to enter the Canadian job market and ultimately secure permanent residency. Canadian employers use the LMIA to prove that hiring a foreign worker will not negatively impact the job opportunities for Canadian citizens or permanent residents. With an approved LMIA, workers can apply for a work permit and start their journey to build a career in Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Diverse Visa, we specialize in not only guiding you through the LMIA application process but also helping you secure a job with Canadian employers, making the path to work in Canada smoother and more accessible.
